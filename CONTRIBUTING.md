# Contributing guidelines

## General guidelines and philosophy

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

Most types of contribution are encouraged and appreciated. See the contents below for the different ways to help and details on how this project handles them. It will make it much easier for maintainers and smooth the experience for all involved.

For those just getting started with pull requests, GitHub has a [how to](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).

- Always open an issue and provide as much context as you can about what you're running into (it is best to search for existing issues that might help you).
- Provide programming language, project, platform and OS versions (nodejs, npm, PHP, Python, Kernel etc), depending on what seems relevant.
- Make sure that you are using the latest version from “base” branch.
- Sign commits locally by using [GPG](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits).
- Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) specification and the commit message should never exceed 100 characters.
- Include unit tests when you contribute new features, as they help to:
  - Prove that your code works correctly.
  - Guard against future breaking changes to lower the maintenance cost.
- Bug fixes also generally require unit tests, because the presence of bugs usually indicates insufficient test coverage.
- Keep compatibility in mind when you do code changes.
- Follow the [KISS principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle), which is an acronym for "Keep it simple, stupid!".
- For full new features (e.g., a cutting-edge algorithm, or anything new) give please some airtime before a decision is made regarding whether they are to be merged to “base” branch.
- As each PR requires several unit tests, submitting a PR just to fix a typo, a warning, etc. is discouraged.
